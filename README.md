## Docker

## Git Flow 

The Git Flow is the most known workflow on this list. It was created by Vincent Driessen in 2010 and it is based in two main branches with infinite lifetime:
- main : this branch contains production code. All development code is merged into main sometime.
- develop : this branch contains pre-production code. When the features are finished then they are merged into develop.

During the development cycle, a variety of supporting branches are used:
- us/* : derived from feature/* if different developers work on a same user story that need to be split.
- feature/* : feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming releases. May branch off from develop and must merge into develop.
- hotfix/* : hotfix branches are necessary to act immediately upon an undesired status of main. May branch off from main and must merge into main anddevelop.
- release/* : release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow many minor bug to be fixed and preparation of meta-data for a release. May branch off from develop and must merge into main and develop.
